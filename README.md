# BBM-409 - Fundamentals of Machine Learning

This repository contains assignments for the **BBM-409 - Fundamentals of Machine Learning** course at Hacettepe University. The assignments cover key topics in machine learning, including Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Understanding Perceptron  
- Implement the **Perceptron Learning Algorithm** from scratch for binary classification using the **Banknote Authentication Dataset**.
- Evaluate performance using **accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision**.
- Visualize the **decision boundary** by reducing the feature space to 2D and comparing it with **Fisher's Linear Discriminant projection**.

### Assignment 2: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree  
- Implement **Logistic Regression** from scratch and train it on the **Bank Marketing Dataset**.
- Train an **SVM model** (using `sklearn`) and evaluate its performance.
- Analyze the impact of different features on classification accuracy using **correlation analysis**.
- Visualize decision boundaries of **Logistic Regression and SVM** for different feature sets.
- Optimize SVM performance using **GridSearchCV**.
- Compare **classification results** of Logistic Regression and SVM in a table.

### Assignment 3: CNN & Transfer Learning  
- Understand and implement **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification.
- Apply **Transfer Learning** techniques using pre-trained models.

### Assignment 4: LSTM for Sentiment Analysis  
- Explore **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** with a focus on **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks.
- Implement **sentiment analysis** on text data.
